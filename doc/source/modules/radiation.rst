Radiation module
=========================

Equations
---------
The radiation module is designed to treat the coupled evolution of a (magneto-)hydrodynamic fluid and a radiative field.
The radiative field is effectively treated as a radiative fluid by solving for the first two moments of the grey radiative transfer equation, the so-called M1 method.
The full set of HD-radiation equation can be written as

.. math::
    \partial_t \rho + \nabla \cdot \left[ \rho \mathbf{v} \right] &= 0,\\
    \partial_t (\rho \mathbf{v}) + \nabla \cdot \left[ \rho \mathbf{v} \otimes \mathbf{v} + \mathcal{P} \mathbb{I} \right] &= -\rho \nabla \psi + \mathbf{G}, \\
    \partial_t E + \nabla \cdot \left[ (E + \mathcal{P}) \mathbf{v} \right] &= -\rho \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \psi + c G^0 - \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}_\mathrm{irr},\\
    \partial_t E_r + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}_r &= -\hat{c}\:G^0, \\
    \partial_t \mathbf{F}_r + \nabla \cdot \mathbb{P}_r &= - \hat{c}\:\mathbf{G},

where :math:`E_r`, :math:`\mathbf{F}_r` and :math:`\mathbb{P}_r` are the radiative energy, the radiative energy flux and the radiative energy tensor defined respectively from the direction and frequency-dependent specific intensity, :math:`I_v(t,\mathbf{x},\mathbf{n})` as

.. math::
    E_r &= \frac{1}{c} \int_0^\infty d\nu \oint d\Omega \, I_\nu(t, \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{n}) \\
    F_r^i &= \frac{1}{c} \int_0^\infty d\nu \oint d\Omega \, I_\nu(t, \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{n})\, n^i \\
    P_r^{ij} &= \frac{1}{c} \int_0^\infty d\nu \oint d\Omega \, I_\nu(t, \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{n})\, n^i n^j.


To close the set of the radiation moment equations, we use the closure from Levermore, C. D. 1984, J. Quant. Spectr. Rad. Transf., 31, 149 :

.. math::
    P^{ij}_r = D^{ij} E_r,
with

.. math::
    D^{ij} = \frac{1 - \xi}{2} \delta^{ij} + \frac{3\xi - 1}{2} n^i n^j,
and

.. math::
    \xi = \frac{3 + 4f^2}{5 + 2\sqrt{4 - 3f^2}},

where :math:`\delta^{ij}` is the Kronecker delta symbol, :math:`\mathbf{n}=\mathbf{F_r}/\lVert\mathbf{F_r}\rVert` is a unit vector pointing in the direction of the radiative flux, and :math:`f` is the so-called reduced flux defined as

.. math::
    f\equiv \frac{\lVert\mathbf{F_r}\rVert}{E_r}\le 1.


The source terms in the radiation equations are defined as

.. math::
    G^0 &= \kappa_\mathrm{P} \, \rho \left( E_r - a_R T^4 \right)  \\
    \mathbf{G} &= \chi \, \rho \, (\mathbf{F}_r-4 E_r\mathbf{\beta}).



where :math:`\kappa_\mathrm{P}` is the Planck absorption opacity, :math:`\chi\equiv\kappa_\mathrm{R}+\sigma` where :math:`\kappa_\mathrm{R}` and :math:`\sigma` are the Rosseland absorption and scattering opacities respectively.
The present formulation of the source terms is only valid for non-relativistic sources with :math:`\beta\equiv\frac{||\mathbf{v}||}{c} \ll 1` so that we only take into account a correction of order :math:`\tau \beta`.
For midly relativistic sources, higher order corrections that are included here are likely to be important.

In addition to the matter-radiation interaction source terms, the user can add an additional heating term :math:`- \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}_\mathrm{irr}`.
This irradiation source term is not part of the radiation scheme.

.. note::

    The radiation module is incompatible with an isothermal equation of state.



Time Integration
----------------

Radiation is solved using an explicit-implicit method. The hyperbolic part of the radiative equations are solved using the finite-volume Godunov high order schemes of *Idefix*.
The source terms are solved using an implicit method.

Explicit part: Reduced speed of light approximation
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In order to reduce the CFL constraint that would arise when dealing with explicit radiation transport at the speed of light, we use the reduced speed of light approximation :math:`\hat{c}`.
The value of  :math:`\hat{c}` is set by the user and should be chosen so that radiation sets the shortest time-scale.

Several

Implicit part:
+++++++++++++++

When the drag is applied with a 1st order implicit scheme, the drag force is applied at the end of each step. In order to avoid
the complete inversion of the system, we follow a simplified inversion procedure, where we first update the gas momentum as:

.. math::

    v_g^{(n+1)}=\left(v_g^{(n)}+\sum_i\frac{\rho_i\gamma_i dt}{1+\rho \gamma_i dt}v_i^{(n)}\right)/\left(1+\sum_i\frac{\rho_i\gamma_i dt}{1+\rho\gamma_idt}\right)

And then update the dust momentum as:

.. math::

    v_i^{(n+1)}=\left(v_i^{(n)}+\rho\gamma_i v_g^{(n+1)}dt\right)/(1+\rho\gamma_i dt)

Note that the latter equation relies on the *updated* gas velocity.

.. warning::
  While the implicit scheme is more stable than the explicit one, and it does not require any additional CFL condition, it is less accurate and
  possibly lead to inacurrate dust velocities when :math:`dt\gg (\gamma_i\rho)^{-1}`. Use it at your own risk.

Using the Radiation module
---------------------

Several examples are provided in the :file:`test/Radiation` directory. Radiation is considered in Idefix as a instance of the `Fluid` class, hence
one can apply the technics used for the gas to the radiation fluid. In order to prepare for future developments, *Idefix* is already able to handle an arbitrarily number of radiation frequency group.
Each frequency group is stored in an instance of `Fluid` and stored in a container (:code:`std::vector radiation`) in the `DataBlock`. The same is true for the mirror `DataBlockHost`: the
radiation primitive variable are all stored in :code:`std::vector RadVc`. However, we emphasize that the current implementation of our source terms only work for one frequency group.

Initialising a single frequency group is done as follow:

.. code-block:: c++


    void Setup::InitFlow(DataBlock &data) {
      // Create a host copy
      DataBlockHost d(data);

      for(int k = 0; k < d.np_tot[KDIR] ; k++) {
          for(int j = 0; j < d.np_tot[JDIR] ; j++) {
              for(int i = 0; i < d.np_tot[IDIR] ; i++) {

                  d.Vc(RHO,k,j,i) = 1.0;            // Set the gas density to 1
                  d.RadVc[0](ER,k,j,i) = 1.0;     // Set first radiation group energy density to 1

                  d.Vc(VX1,k,j,i) = 1;              // Set the gas velocity to 1
                  d.RadVc[0](FR1,k,j,i) = 0.0;     // Set the radiation energy flux to 0

              }
          }
      }

      // Send it all, if needed
      d.SyncToDevice();
    }



All of the radiation fields are automatically outputed in the dump and vtk outputs created by *Idefix*.
